Contains the BUR Unity Sim for the 2024 - 2025 season

The Sim file should contain the 
- Asset
- Packages
- UserSettings
- ProjectSettings
of a unity file and should create a copy of the sim if copy and replaced into a new unity project in **2022.3.48f1**

The Unity project uses Unity Perception and some Unity Blender Images, so you may need to re-add the blender files to the project, or re-add the images to the blender files to make it work correctly

The blender files folder contains all the blender files used in the project, it technically shouldn't need to be added because it should already be in the asset files of the unity project.
